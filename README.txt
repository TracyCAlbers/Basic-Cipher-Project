# Basic-Cipher-Project

After compiling the code, required arguments are:  cipher <slope> <intercept> <e/d> <filepath>

Here, I used C to create a very simple enciphering and deciphering program using Aphine Ciphers.  The program works on the bit level and is successful in both encryption and decryption.  

While a lot of fun, Aphine Ciphers are inherently insecure as seen by the still-encrypted disco version of the donut.
